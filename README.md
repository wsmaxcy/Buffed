**Buffed** is a World of Warcraft addon that transforms your in-game downtime into an opportunity to track your fitness goals. This addon provides real-time workout tracking and calorie calculations based on your physical details, helping you stay "buffed" both in and out of the game.

## Features

- **Calorie Tracking**: Calculates calories burned per hour based on your weight, height, and gender.
- **Workout Monitoring**: Tracks specific exercises, including:
  - Push-ups
  - Pull-ups
  - Sit-ups
  - Pistol squats
  - Planking (seconds)
- **Session and Total Tracking**: Displays exercise stats for your current session and total progress.
- **Customizable Options**: Input your weight, height, and gender to personalize your calorie burn calculations.
- **Real-Time Workout Alerts**: When you finish resting in-game, Buffed pops up to display your workout plan.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the Buffed addon from the [Releases](https://github.com/wsmaxcy/Buffed/releases) section.
2. Extract the ZIP file into your World of Warcraft `Interface\AddOns` folder. The typical path is: `\Interface\AddOns`
3. Launch World of Warcraft, go to the AddOns menu, and enable Buffed.

## Usage

To open the Buffed options menu, type the following command in the in-game chat:
> **Note:** Due to a known glitch, you may need to enter the command twice.

```

## How It Works

- **Resting Detection**: Buffed automatically activates when you rest (e.g., at inns or cities).  
- **Workout Plan**: It calculates exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and planking based on how long you've been resting.  
- **Pop-Up Alert**: Upon leaving the resting state, a pop-up appears with your personalized workout.

### Workout Results Display

The popup provides:  
- **Now**: Exercises calculated based on the latest rest period.  
- **Session**: Cumulative exercises during your current gaming session.

**Completed** text changes color depending on how much **WORK** you do in your session. Can you make it to Legnedary?

## Shame

If you choose to press the **I Won't** button, be prepared to suffer from shame.
